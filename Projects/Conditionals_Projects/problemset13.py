# Pet Food Recommendation
# Problem: Recommend a type of pet food based on the pet's species and age.
# e.g., Dog:<2 years-Puppy food, Cat:>5 years-senior cat food).

# animal = "Cat"
# year = 5
# if(animal == "Dog" and year <= 2):
#     print("Puppy food")
# elif(animal=="Cat" and  year >=5):
#     print("senior cat food")
# else:
#     print("Milk")


# shorthand if else

# a = 70
# b = 20
# bigger = a if a > b else b
# print("Bigger is", bigger)


# if(10<5):print("Hi") 
# else: print("Hello")
